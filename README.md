# Smart Thermostat-
This Arduino C++ code uses the FreeRTOS library to manage tasks such as reading temperature data, displaying it on a seven-segment display, and controlling a fan. It includes tasks for blinking an LED, reading from a DHT11 sensor, and adjusting the fan temperature threshold with a potentiometer.
